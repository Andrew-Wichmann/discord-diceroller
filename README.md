# imperial-dicebot
A Discord.py die rolling bot for Imperial Dawn, an excellent tabletop RPG
The game itself is available for free at https://imperialdawn.com and it's pretty good.
This uses the discord.py library available at https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
It's pretty good, and as you can see, quite easy to set up for simple bots.

When making a discord bot, be sure that you are trying to log in with your bot's token, not their Client ID or Client secret. You can do so with this code by creating a text file called "token" (not "token.txt", "token.docx", or "token.pdf", just "token") in the same directory as the code, and pasting your token into it without leaving anything in the file.

This code should be considered free to use or learn from by anyone, attribution is preferred if appropriate but not required. There's probably an official license that says that, but I don't feel like digging through contracts right now, and realistically nobody's gonna rip off a bot this simple. I probably wouldn't even care if they did.
